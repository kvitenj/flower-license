## 🧠 Why This License?

It's important for some developers to explicitly limit how their work can be reused - particularly by oppressive regimes or in the training of artificial intelligence systems.

The Flower License offers a lightweight yet expressive solution.

I do **not** accept requests to change the core restrictions of the license.
